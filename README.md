# Pong Game - Pygame 

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Pygame library in Python. It features a menu with two playing modes: **single-player mode** (compete against opponent AI) and **player vs player mode** (compete with someone else). Additionally, the game includes a countdown counter at the beginning to allow users to get ready for the game and displays the score of the current match.
